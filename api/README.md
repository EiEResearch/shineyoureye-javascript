                "author": "EiENigeria",
                "body": "<p>52 days after he was sworn-in, President Muhammadu Buhari last week submitted the much-awaited ministerial nominees list to the Senate for consideration and confirmation. The team is made up of 43 names, 14 of them former ministers in his first term.</p>\n<p>To get him to release the names was like pulling the chestnuts out of the fire. The Senate had met him earlier in the month on the matter; and later reminded him of the need to submit the list before July 26th or wait until its members returned from their annual vacation in September. During their engagement, the President revealed being under pressure. He justified his delay on the grounds that he did not want to repeat the mistake of his first term, when he picked mostly people the party and individuals recommended to him.</p>\n<p>With his “Next Level” agenda, therefore, he pleaded for more time to enable him to recruit only those with the capacity to deliver. But this time he said, “I am going to be quite me; me in the sense that I will pick people I know personally.”  However, most of the faces he unfurled are familiar; none of them came from the moon as to justify his purported thoroughness.</p>\n<p>The task of choosing ministers is not rocket science. Buhari’s lumbering approach to governance rankles, viewed against the background of the speed of light with which global leaders respond to similar responsibilities. </p>\n<p>For instance, the new United Kingdom Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, who just took over from Theresa May, promptly picked his cabinet the same day. Ending his speech after he defeated Jeremy Hunt to emerge as leader of the Conservative Party, Johnson declared, “Today, the campaign is over and the work begins.” According to The Sun of London, he spent the next 24 hours locked away with aides gathering a “Cabinet for Modern Britain,” which will deliver Brexit and his domestic policies.</p>\n<p>Not with Buhari. Here, a ministerial list that took five months to compile is thin on acclaimed technocrats or policy wonks. It comprises some allegedly recycled corrupt politicians, many of whom failed woefully in their previous public offices; further putting his commitment to uprooting corruption and uplifting the economy into question. The team, which the Senate began screening already, does not command public confidence.</p>\n<p>The President, as usual, did not attach portfolios to the nominees. It is a discredited practice that makes a mockery of ministerial screening in the country, as it gives no room for ascertaining their competence or suitability. It is hypocritical that Buhari, with his preachment of “not business as usual,” still embraces this old order, which has short-changed the country in terms of service delivery. That the constitution does not prescribe attachment of portfolios does not mean it cannot be done. It does not breach any law. The Senate, which vowed to improve on the performance of the Eighth Senate, has failed its first litmus <br />\ntest, by accepting this and the banality of “bow and go” by 20 ministerial nominees.</p>\n<p>However, many were not shocked by Buhari’s delay as it took him much longer in his first term to form his cabinet. But given his assurances, the quality of the team assembled should have compensated for time wasted. Unfortunately, it did not happen, again. The capacity for them to push the agenda for development for Nigeria is very much in doubt. Nigeria is seeing a President who is so widely unable to fulfil his responsibilities.</p>\n<p>Consequently, the fear that the economy might not be free from its fetters in Buhari’s second term with his present recruits is not unfounded.</p>",

Ali Ndume, from Borno, who scored 28 votes.</p>\n<p>The House of Representatives also elected Mr Femi Gbajabiamila (APC-Lagos), as the speaker of the 9th House of Representatives when he polled 281 votes against Umar Bago, who got 76.</p>\n<p>After all the hullabaloo, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) got what it wanted in terms of the calibre of persons to occupy the seats of principal officers of the National Assembly.</p>\n<p>However, apprehensions have been rife among Nigerians that by allowing the presidency to have its way in the selection of the principal officers, the ability of the upper chamber of the legislature to perform its constitutional role of providing checks and balances to the executive has been circumscribed.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, the election of Senator Ahmed Lawan as the 14th Senate President, which came as a kind of indemnity to the party over its loss in 2015, also subtly stoked recollections about the emergence Dr. Bukola Saraki as the president of the 8th Senate.</p>\n<p>Against the background of those considerations, the question on the minds of Nigerians is, what kind of Senate would the 9th session witness in terms of relationship with the executive, among members as well as legislative processes.</p>\n<p>Would both Senator Lawan as Senate President and Gbajabiamila as the Speaker of the 9th National Assembly embark on a programme of witch-hunt against all those that sided Saraki and Dogora to deny both of them the office in the just concluded 8th National Assembly? How far would the new leadership fare in averting recriminations over the sharing of committees’ chairmanship?</p>\n<p>Although it was obvious that pro-Saraki Senators in the 9th Senate voted against Lawan given the number with which he defeated Senator Ali Ndume, there are still fears that some sort of vengeance could be in the offing against those that supported Saraki.</p>\n<p>Senator Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan comes off as a seasoned educator and an experienced legislator with over 20 years’ service in both lower and upper legislative chambers. As President of the 9th National Assembly, therefore, it could be rightly said that Lawan bears the legislative history of 20 years of Nigeria’s current democratic experience.</p>",
